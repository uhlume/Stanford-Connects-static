To more fully understand modernist practices, Professor Wanda Corn will explore artists' choice of everyday dress, paying particular attention to Georgia O'Keeffe.</p>

                                    <p>Today we know infinitely more about how the human brain works than we did 30 years ago; we know almost nothing compared with what we will know 30 years from now. This revolution in neuroscience is being driven by medical concerns and funding, but it will have vast implications in other areas of our society as well, from the use of neuroimaging-based mind-reading in court to the creation of cognitive enhancing drugs. In this talk, Professor Hank Greely will review some of the ways neuroscience will change our world.</p>

                                    <p>We all begin life as a stem cell. Then, through a wildly complex series of events, those few stem cells develop into all of the specialized cells found in our adult bodies. Professor Jill Helms will talk about the field of stem cell research, highlighting recent advances at Stanford and beyond. This research holds an awesome potential for restructuring the way we practice medicine, by using stem cells to replace or repair damaged tissues and organs and to dramatically alter how we treat diseases like cancer.</p>

                                    <p>For many people, creativity can be fickle, slippery and elusive. Lecturer Dan Klein's hands-on workshop explores the techniques that professional improvisers use to develop and access their creativity on demand, applicable offstage as well.  In this fun and unique workshop, you'll learn how to be comfortable with coming up with ideas on the fly and expressing them in a compelling way.</p>

In Minnesota and western Wisconsin, Second Harvest Heartland in St. Paul distributes more than 51 million pounds of food and grocery products annually.

                                    <p>Creativity often feels like a mystery. Whether we are struggling to generate fresh ideas or staring at problems with no solutions in sight, the spark of creative genius often seems out of reach. In this workshop, Professor Tina Seelig, PhD '85, reveals a set of tools and conditions that we each control-our Innovation Engine-that allows us to increase our own creativity and that of our teams and organizations. She shows that just as the scientific method demystifies the process of discovery, there is a formal process for unlocking the pathway to invention.</p>

                                    <p>Last year, Stanford could have filled its freshman class four times over with applicants who had a 4.0 GPA. This year, Stanford received over 38,000 freshman applications-a new record-for an entering class of about 1,700. Applications to top universities continue to climb. Columbia, Duke, the University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern, NYU, the University of Chicago and USC all have applicant pools topping 30,000. What's an admission dean to do? Join Dean of Admission Richard H. Shaw for a lively discussion about how Stanford approaches the increasingly competitive world of college admission and find out how to get involved as an alumni interviewer through the OVAL program. </p>
